PyPIToken is an open-source Python 3.8+ library for generating and manipulating
PyPI tokens.

PyPI tokens are very powerful, as that they are based on Macaroons_. They allow
the bearer to add additional restrictions to an existing token. For example, given
a PyPI token that can upload releases for any project of its owner, you can generate
a token that will only allow some projects, or even a single one.

.. _macaroons: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroons_(computer_science)

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pypitoken

.. code-block:: python

    import pypitoken

    token = pypitoken.Token.load("pypi-foobartoken")

    print(token.restrictions)
    # [ProjectIDsRestriction(project_ids=["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"])]

    token.restrict(project_names=["requests"])

    print(token.restrictions)
    # [
    #     ProjectIDsRestriction(project_ids=["00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"]),
    #     ProjectNamesRestriction(project_names=["requests"]),
    # ]

    token.dump()
    # pypi-newfoobartoken

This token we've created above will be restricted to uploading releases of ``requests``.
Of course, your PyPI user will still need to have upload permissions on ``requests``
for this to happen.

The aim of this library is to provide a simple toolbelt for manipulating PyPI tokens.
Ideally, someday, PyPI (Warehouse_) itself may generate their tokens using this
library too. This should make it easier to iterate on new kinds of restrictions for
PyPI tokens, such as those discussed in the `original implementation issue`__.

A discussion for integrating this library to the Warehouse environment is ongoing:

- In the `Python Packaging discussions`_ for putting the project under the PyPA umbrella
- In the `Warehouse tracker`_ for replacing the current macaroon implementation with
  this lib
