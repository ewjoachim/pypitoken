PyPIToken is an open-source Python 3.6+ library for generating and manipulating
PyPI tokens.

PyPI tokens are very powerful, as that they are based on Macaroons_. They allow
the bearer to add additional restrictions to an existing token. For example, given
a PyPI token that can upload releases for any project of its owner, you can generate
a token that will only allow some projects, or even a single one.

.. _macaroons: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroons_(computer_science)

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pypitoken

.. code-block:: python

    import pypitoken

    token = pypitoken.Token.load("pypi-foobartoken")

    print(token.restrictions)
    # [NoopRestriction()]

    token.restrict(projects=["requests"])

    print(token.restrictions)
    # [NoopRestriction(), ProjectsRestriction(projects=["requests"])]

    token.dump()
    # pypi-newfoobartoken

This token we've created above will be restricted to uploading releases of ``requests``.
Of course, your PyPI user will still need to have upload permissions on ``requests``
for this to happen.

The aim of this library is to provide a simple toolbelt for manipulating PyPI tokens.
Ideally, someday, PyPI (Warehouse_) itself may generate their tokens using this
library too. This should make it easier to iterate on new kinds of restrictions for
PyPI tokens, such as those discussed in the `original implementation issue`__:

- Tokens scoped to a specific time interval
- Tokens scoped to uploading a given version
- Tokens scopes to uploading a given release
- Tokens scopes to uploading a file with a given hash
- (Maybe even one-time tokens)
