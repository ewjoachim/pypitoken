So PyPI tokens are based on Macaroons.

What is a macaroon, how does it work, how is it secure?
-------------------------------------------------------

At heart, a macaroon is an introspectable token, it lets its bearer be identified.
There's an identifier, which is readable in the token, and a secret key which is
not included in the macaroon.
A HMAC_ hash of the identifier and the secret key is also present in the token.
This results in the following properties:

- Given a macaroon, you can extract the identifier easily
- If you know the identifier and the key, you can check that the macaroon has not
  been modified
- Given just the macaroon, you cannot extract the key. The key is the secret part that
  lets you generate and check a macaroon's authenticity.

But then the power of the macaroon comes from the following: you can add caveats to
the macaroon. A caveat is a readable string. When you add a caveat, you take the
previous ``HMAC``, and use it as a key for a new HMAC of the caveat. This gives you
the following properties:

- Given a macaroon, you can still extract the identifier and the caveat strings
- Given a macaroon and its key, you can check each step by computing the same ``HMAC``
  on your side and check that your hash is still consistent
- Given a macaroon, anyone can add a caveat
- Given a macaroon without the key, it's impossible to remove a caveat. Intermediate
  hashes are discarded each time you add a caveat, so the only way is forward (adding
  more caveats).

The specification doesn't say what the caveat strings should be, but the idea is that
each caveat is adding a restriction to the original macaroon, so that when the bearer
has to send the macaroon, they only delegate the smallest fraction of their power.

It's up to the Macaroon original minter to decide how to understand the caveats,
but when they receive a macaroon for

How are macaroons implemented in this library?
----------------------------------------------

TL;DR: they're not :D This library is a abstraction over PyMacaroons_, but with a
specialization on the needs of PyPI. Here are a few things this library does:

- Distinguish between ``tokens`` and ``macaroons``. PyPI tokens have a ``pypi-`` prefix.
  A token is a serialized macaroon with a prefix.
- Rename caveats "restrictions". The word caveat is nice and latin and all, but as
  far as the author can tell, in international contexts, people tend not to understand
  immediately what "caveat" mean in this context. Given the idea of this lib is to
  ease the use of PyPI tokens, where those caveats are mainly used as restrictions,
  it felt more logical to name it this way.

How are macaroons implemented in PyPI?
--------------------------------------

PyPI keeps a database table of macaroons, with identifiers, keys, and related users.
When a macaroon bearer uploads a release using their macaroon, the identifier is read,
then from the database, the key and user are extracted. The macaroon is checked using
the key and caveats are checked against the upload information. If the macaroon is
valid, then PyPI checks if the user has upload rights on the package, and then proceeds.

The caveats are json-encoded strings, and as of March 2021, they come in 2 flavors:

- ``"{"version": 1, "permissions": "user"}"`` (note: it's the string ``"user"`` here,
  not a placeholder for the username), which is always met. It's represented in this
  library by the class ``NoopPermission``,
- ``"{"version": 1, "permissions": {"projects": ["<project name>", ...]}}"`` (note:
  ``"<project name>"`` is a placeholder here). It's met if the project we upload
  is among the ones listed in the caveats.

Do we really need an abstraction layer over PyMacaroons?
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes ? No ? Maybe ? What's clear is that the implementation in PyPI is adding some
unnecessary complexity, and the community would benefit from a single source of
macaroons, so that the same codebase will be responsible for serializing and
deserializing the custom PyPI token restrictions.

Can we add new restrictions?
----------------------------

As long as PyPI doesn't use ``pypitoken`` to generate tokens, it's not very useful
to implement new restrictions. But once we get it merged, then we'll want to add plenty
of new and smart restrictions (based on time, upload file name and hash, etc)

Is this library a part of PyPI?
-------------------------------

It's being developper externally. The initiator of this project is a member of the
Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) and PyPI moderator, but not an admin nor a committer.

As of today, the library is not part of the PyPA. Once this lib is done, it's planned
to apply for this lib to be added to PyPA.

.. _Macaroon recipe:

All this talking about Macaroons, I'm hungry now!
-------------------------------------------------

Here's a recipe for Montmorillon Macaroons, as done in the author's region.
Note that it's using SI units.

Ingredients:

- Sugar: 125g
- Ground almonds: 150g
- Egg white: 70g (that's 2 eggs)
- Bitter almond (few drops)

Steps:

1. Preheat oven to 50째C.
2. Spread the gound almonds on a baking sheet, put in oven for 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Remove it from oven, let it cool and mix with sugar.
4. Whip the egg whites stiff and add a few drops of bitter almond.
5. Using a rubber spatula, fold the egg whites into the sugar & almond batter.
6. Pour the batter into a piping bag with a ribbed nozzle.
7. Form the macaroons on baking paper and leave it to rest for 2h at ambiant
   temperature.
8. Preheat oven to 190째C.
9. Lower the oven to 180째C, and put the macaroons in for 3 minutes, then 15 minutes at
   160째C.
10. Allow to cool before yummy time.
